You were warned to take care while leafing through it’s pages, but took no heed. Now you find yourself suddenly in a small, provincial town where once your own home used to be. Instead of the familiar contemporary furnishings there are thatch roof houses and rustic peasants gawking at your unusual clothes. You have become the hero of your own story! You see to the right of you a slightly muddy road stretching off into the horizon of patchwork fields, and to the left the same road bends toward a wooded glen. Where do you go now?</p>',

How fortunate that the common language always seems to be English in these stories. Concerned murmurs among the villagers had begun to grow louder at your sudden presence, and you decided it best to leave in a hurry. The road was slick with mud, and the hay laid by the villagers did little to ease your trek. Once you reach the tree line you find that the canopy had provided cover from the elements and left the path more firm.</p>  <p>You walk for some time through the sun dappled forest until you come upon a fork in the road. One pathway looks very much like the other, and when you try to read the road marker planted between them, you find that the words had worn away with age. For several moments you ponder what to do, it would be dark before you could make it back to the village, and you had a fifty fifty chance of choosing the right path and making it to the city. Which way do you go?</p>',

Concerned murmurs among the villagers had begun to grow louder at your sudden presence, and you decided it best to leave in a hurry. The mud on the road is just enough make your trek up and down the shallow hills that much more difficult, and leaves you breathing hard. Off in the distance you see a tree, and think it an excellent spot to rest.</p> <p>As you approach you see a series of gibbets hanging from its low branches, one containing an old man wrapped in a thin, graying blanket. When you draw nearer he rattles a dented, tin cup against the bars of his cage, and calls out. In a rasping voice he begs for a drink of water from a nearby stream to slack his terrible thirst</p>',

The further you go the darker it gets as the day fades into evening, and in the twilight you begin to feel that the trees are taking on a leering quality. The air begins to smell fetid, and your shoes begin to squelch in murky puddles that are difficult to avoid in the half light.</p> <p>You try to turn around, but the path has been lost beneath the ground water. For what seems like hours you wander the endless morass, and the thin skeletal trees have provided enough light to see you’ve become lost in a swamp. The hair on your neck stand on end, as frightening as it was to be lost and alone, you are finding what is even scarier is the feeling that you are now being watched. Gurgling, retching sounds emanate from the darkness around you, and very soon your screams are lost in the empty night.</p>'},
    {name: 'AB2', story: '<p>After much inner deliberation you decide on the right path and set off at a newly invigorated pace. After a time the day fades into a golden twilight, and you begin to wonder if the road you picked was the correct one. Your thoughts are interrupted however by a large mirror laying on the ground in front of you. The edges are wrought with gilded filigree, and when you look into it you can see your reflection, and the inexplicable reflection of an ornate ceiling above you.</p> <p>Picking up the mirror you can see the interior of this phantom room, and a large door in one of it’s walls. Leaning it up against a tree you gaze in and around the mirror in puzzlement. Finally you reach for the door knob, delicately carved in the likeness of climbing ivy, and turn it. The door swings open and you find yourself pulled into the room beyond. With dizzying speed you are thrown from the books pages and onto your own couch, and onto a very angry pet cat that yowls at how nearly it was crushed. The wind is knocked from your lungs, but you are home and alive. What a grand ending.</p>'},
    {name: 'BA2', story: '<p>Taking pity on this filthy, slightly dotty old man you are filled with a determination to set him free, as any good hero would. Picking up a sharp looking rock from the ground you poise it to strike the heavy metal padlock holding the cage’s tiny door closed. The prisoner within wails about his thirst and that you are wasting time on an impossible task.</p> <p>The sound of stone on iron rang out loudly with each successive hit, and each time it seemed to vibrate more and more violently. Suddenly it began to jump and bounce seemingly of its own accord, it bends and grows before your eyes until it takes on the shape of a spiny metal gargoyle. The lock had been enchanted to attack whoever tried to open it without the proper key.</p> <p>The creature set upon you, and without a weapon you were little match for the beast. You lay dead in the road while the old man continued to bang his cup against the bars of the cage in hopes of gaining an easement for his endless thirst.</p>'},
    {name: 'BB2', story: '<p>You take the cup from this poor old man’s outstretched hand, and make off in the direction he points. After a half hour’s walk you see a large stream ahead running swiftly, it’s edges high on the bank from recent rain. You fill your cup and race back, careful not to spill your precious cargo. Upon your return the old man flails his arms madly in eagerness, and immediately gulps down the container’s contents the moment it touches his knobby fingers. Water dribbles down the side of his mouth and into his ragged beard, and after an exhalation of satisfaction wipes his face on the edge of the grimy blanket draped about his thin shoulders.</p> <p>“Thank you for this kindness, Stranger. Even the smallest deed can have great consequences. I know you seek a way home, and I may be able to help you on your quest.”</p> <p>With a snap of his fingers, the gibbet and the old vagrant vanished to be replaced by an elderly man in rich robes and a jaunty hat. He smiled sagely, and with another snap you feel yourself being pulled by an intangible force and are flung from the pages of your book onto the flimsy, Ikea coffee table. With a crash you lay among it’s splintered pieces stunned, but alive and home. What a grand ending.</p>'},
